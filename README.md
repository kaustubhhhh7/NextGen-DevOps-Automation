# NextGen DevOps Automation

## Project Vision
NextGen DevOps Automation is engineered to redefine the standard for modern software delivery by seamlessly integrating automated CI/CD pipelines with robust Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. Built for the cloud-native era, the project focuses on establishing a resilient ecosystem where automated monitoring and enterprise-grade security are intrinsic to the lifecycle. By incorporating AI-assisted DevOps automation, we aim to streamline operational workflows, enhance predictive incident management, and optimize resource utilization, providing a scalable and intelligent foundation for continuous digital innovation.
